Project Ideas:  
Todd - AI Monitored streetlamps  
Todd - Traffic monitoring w/deep learning

Dany - "Kindness to self"
    
    1. Let people approach the monitor which displays the message 
    "record your voice, saying a message of kindness or an encouragement for someone having hard time"
    
    2. Detect their faces meanwhile (to display later on) -> 
    
    3. Show video of their face saying that phrase, (produced by deep fake tech!) looking right back to the person :) = to themselves

Wonjun - Object Detection + OCR(text to voice, translation of text to voice) for Blind People

    Goal: to be able to identify objects, and writings on the objects without the need of touching them, or without the assistance of another person.
    
    1. Potential Use: Grocery Store. Object Detected: "Cereal", Text Detected: "Ingredients in (English)", translate it to other languages if the user wants
    
    2. On the streets? I think it would be dangerous at this point, but could potentially be useful for reading street signs, geological locations, and etc...
