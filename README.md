Project Ideas:  
Todd - AI Monitored streetlamps  
Todd - Traffic monitoring w/deep learning

Dany - "Kindness to self"
    
    1. Let people approach the monitor which displays the message 
    "record your voice, saying a message of kindness or an encouragement for someone having hard time"
    
    2. Detect their faces meanwhile (to display later on) -> 
    
    3. Show video of their face saying that phrase, (produced by deep fake tech!) looking right back to the person :) = to themselves
